1Block is a passwordless authentication protocol using Blockchain technology.

== Description ==

As everyone knows passwords are hard to remember, hard to manage, and subject to compromise. 1Block is an authentication manager that is simple, secure, and requires no passwords. One ID is all you need. Logins happen via a QR code, and no sensitive or personal information ever passes over the network. 1Block uses Blockchain technology, the same security used by Bitcoin.

Your ID is never exposed outside of your device, and it is stored encrypted. There are no trusted third parties required (ie. DropBox.) Because of this secure design, changing passwords becomes a thing of the past. In the unfortunate event your ID is compromised, ID revoking and replacing is an easy and built-in feature.

1Block boils this technology down to an easy user experience, and also easy and flexible server implementations. 1Block can replace traditional password logins, or act as a secondary factor of authentication, or used for any implementation where secure proof of ownership is required. 1Block is free to use and open-source. Transparency is an honor badge for security.

The 1Block mobile clients are available via Google Play store and the Apple App store, search for "1Block". This wordpress plugin adds 1Block authentication to the wordpress admin login. To setup 1Block for a user, login to wordpress with the traditional password login and go to your user control panel.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
